This directory holds the files of the Qt user interface. All Python
files with a name beginning with a 'u' are generated
from their corresponding ui-files in the Ui-directory. To regenerate
the u* files: run make. Subclasses keep the name of their parents
except for the leading 'u'.

In other words: The Qt designer generates a uFoo.ui XML-file
describing the dialogue. The makefile translates this into the Python
file uFoo.py. We then subclass this file in Foo.py.

The images needed by the application sit in the ../img-directory.
