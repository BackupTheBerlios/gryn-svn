These reports are not for the Norwegian locale only, but generates reports
of a structure that is acceptable in Norway. So the .no suffix do not indicate
a locale but a style. Feel free to use these reports
for other locales too. But if the generated reports do not fit your culture or
your personal taste you may create an other report directory for your
alternatives and link from Report to your directory.
