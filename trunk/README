Gryn and/or Qdough, a program for keeping your accounting books under Gnu/Linux

This file is the basic 'how to get the program running' help for the 
book keeping application Gryn/Qdough. 
The present GUI is implemented with the Qt library.

For license, copying, source code modification, derivative work and 
distribution of all or part of this application: see the LICENSE file. 

Contact:

The project home page: http://gryn.berlios.de
email: oao#users:berlios:de (':' -> '.', '#' -> '@')

Install: 

Unpack the tar archive somewhere in your home directory and run the top 
Makefile:

> make install

>export PYTHONPATH=pathto/gryn:$PYTHONPATH

and run the program

>pathto/gryn/Control/Qd.py

Before running the program for the first time you should manually 
create an empty MySQL database named 'gryn', else the program will terminate.

Latex-files are installed by links in ~/texmf/tex/latex. 
You may have to refresh the TeX directory cache to make them visible to LaTeX.

The program uses Norwegian translation as default. Make yourself a  ~/.gryn
resource file if you wish something
similar to English: 

>echo 'locale=None' > ~/.gryn

However, some translations will still be in Norwegian, edit the
Model/Global.py file (specify a nonexistent locale, like 'xx' instead of 'no')

Default encoding is set to latin-1 in the sitecustomize.py file. 


Prerequisites: 
In addition to a modern Linux installation you will  
need rather up to date versions of the following:

Python (http://www.python.org)

Qt (http://www.trolltech.com)

PyQt, sip  (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk)

MySql (http://www.mysql.com/)

MySQLdb (http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb) 

TeX, LaTeX to print reports

Some of these may be found on your Linux distribution CD.
