<h2>Gryn, an accounting program for GNU/Linux</h2>
</td></tr></table>

Gryn is an accounting program which can be run under GNU/Linux. The aim is to
provide an accounting program for education, small business and
organizations. The program is licensed under the GNU GPL license, the main
point of this license is that you may freely copy and distribute the program.<p> 
The program is presently in an alpha state, i.e. most of the functionality is
present, but so are probably more or less serious bugs. Gryn is therefore not
suitable for serious book keeping yet. To try the program you can 
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gryn/"> download the
full source package here.</a><p> 

Gryn is, and shall remain, an independent unit to be used for an independent
task: to keep accounting books. Other business activities will usually be
performed by other persons at other times and are best served by other
programs. Examples of such tasks not fit to be mixed with an accounting unit
are invoicing and payroll.<p> 

However, transfer of data between programs is useful. The present version of
Gryn can import data from an fictive invoice program. Invoice data are queued
in the database and fetched by Gryn at the book keeper's demand. All invoices
are then automatically entered into the books. Gryn will share the database
with other programs, so e.g. information about a customer will be available to
both 
the invoice and Gryn programs.



<h4>Overview of functionality</h4>
The program is rather complete, i.e. the most important functionality is
present: 
<ul>
<li>An unlimited number of clients. A client is an independent set of books,
perhaps a company or one of many
student assignments. </li>
<li>Import of chart of accounts from one of many text files when a client is
created. The client's account plan can then be edited at later stages.</li> 
<li>Creation, editing and deletion of customers and vendors.</li>
<li>Creation, editing and deletion of what I call sources. A source is a
complete description of a transaction, amounts, affected accounts, and link to
subsidiary ledger for an involved customer or vendor. Not fully paid invoices
are passed over to new year.</li>
<li>One may define rules for frequently used or complex types of
transactions. Rules are created interactively and cause dialogs to appear when
a rule is called for.</li>
<li>VAT calculations and postings for a period are programmed, any number of
VAT rates may be involved.</li>
<li>Automatic entry of imported invoices.</li>
<li>Reports can be filtered by several criteria, like date interval. The
present program version can produce main ledger report, source list and
subsidiary ledger reports. Reports are displayed and may be printed.</li>
<li>The most important functions still missing are automatic transfer to new
year and a number of kinds of reports.
</li>
</ul>
Some examples of dialogs are described below. I do not have English
screen shots now, so the examples are for the Norwegian locale. 

<h4>Dialog example: Source entry</h4>
<img src="img/vindu_bilag.png" alt="source entry dialog"><p>
The upper fields are for date and source reference number. Next comes a text
entry field for customer or vendor. This field uses regular expressions, so
only part of a name have to be entered. The third line is a text for
describing the transactions. If a rule is used and the Auto-box is checked the
default text of the rule is used. A rule may be chosen from the combo box.<p>

When a customer or vendor is specified all related invoices not fully payed
are listed. If one of them is clicked the amount and account will
automatically be entered in the posting list. Below this subsidiary ledger
reference list one may choose the VAT rate and if the amounts given below is
net or including VAT.<p>

Postings are entered by stating the account and amount. Accounts are given by
number or by part of the account name (regular expression). When entering an
amount any VAT rate given by the VAT combo box will be calculated and
posted.<p> 

Any imbalance
between debit and credit is displayed below the list box. By pressing a
'rounding'-button any imbalance will be automatically posted to a rounding
account.

<h4>Dialog example: Posting rule </h4>
<img src="img/vindu_ruledef.png" alt="regeldialog">&nbsp;
<img src="img/vindu_rulerun.png" alt="regeldialog"><p>
A set of postings may be automated by rules. The dialog at the left shows an
example of a rule definition. Here we define the name of the rule to appear in
the rule combo box, the default descriptive text and a number of
parameters. Parameters are usually amounts (the M-box is checked) or real
numbers e.g. a percentage. We define a parameter name (used when executing the
rule) and a text used for the dialog.<p>
The prelude is regular Python code to be run before the postings are
calculated. Below are the definitions of the postings, i.e. the account, side
(debit or credit) and a python expression to be evaluated.<p>

The dialog to the right pops up when this example rule is used. All defined
parameters are listed and the user fills in the amounts or percentages.

<h4>Chart of accounts window</h4>
<p><img src="img/vindu_ktre2.png" alt="chart of accounts 2">&nbsp;
<img src="img/vindu_ktre1.png" alt="chart of accounts 1"><p>
The chart of accounts window displays a tree of accounts and may be open at all
times. The accounts which are used are marked with a green tick. The window to
the right shows the same chart, but in this case only the used accounts are
included.<p>
If the user clicks an account a signal will be generated. This signal
includes the account instance and may be caught by other parts of the
program. As an example: if one is about to fill in the account name in a
posting list the clicked account number and name will automatically be filled
into the appropriate fields.

  
<h4>Report example: Source list</h4>
<img src="img/vindu_rapbil.png" alt="Source list"><p>
The screen shot shows the first sources year 2005 for the company 'Godt
parti'.
Source number 0 and 1 are used for any transfers from the previous
year. Number 0 is automatically generated and number 1 is reserved for any
manual corrections. In this example there is not transfers.<p>
For every source the source reference number, date, possibly a customer or
vendor name and the descriptive text appear at the first line. Then follows
the postings: account number and name and amount. Any reference through the
subsidiary ledger is also shown, like in the last line of source number 3.
This invoice was payed by two transfers as per source number 6 and 7.


<h4>Report example: Subsidiary ledger</h4>
<img src="img/vindu_rapresk.png" alt="subsidiary ledger"><p>
This example shows the transactions for some of the vendors of 'Godt parti'.
In this case all transactions relating to each vendor is present. One may also
use a filter, e.g. to include only the vendors with unsettled invoices.<p>

Clicking the printer icon will print the report, part of the first page
printed is displayed below.<p>
<img src="img/vindu_rapreskps.png" alt="subsidiary ledger print out">

<h4>Implementation</h4>
The program is written in Python and consists of three layers: GUI, a model
and a storage interface. The model is totally independent of the GUI.<p> 

The GUI is implemented by the Qt-library through the PyQt/sip library. Qt is
present in most Linux distributions.<p>

 MySql is used
for data storage, but other databases or XML-file storage may be implemented
by adding code in the storage backend.<p>

LaTeX is used for report printing. The basic macros are defined, so producing
new kinds of reports are fairly simple.<p>

Although the primary locale now is Norwegian, the program is written and
commented in English. So a fairly English version can be achieved by disabling
the locale.
